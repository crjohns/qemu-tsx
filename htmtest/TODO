TODO List for HTM:

Implement transactional memory by changing memory load microcode

mov (location), T0;

becomes:

mov (env->rtm_active), T0
test T0, T0
jne chkfail
## find cache line in transaction cache, set ZF if found ##
jne chkfail ; Jump if not managed by txn (main memory value is correct)
mov (relevant part of cache line), T0
jmp done
skip: mov (location), T0
done:

This checks if RTM is active, and if so it will use copies from some transactional
cache tagged by address/CACHE_LINE_SIZE containing the cache line data. This is
this CPU's private copy for transactions (their write set).

Writes will need to check if RTM is active and, if so, create new entries in the
transactional cache.
