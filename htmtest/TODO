TODO List for HTM:

Figure out threading 
Figure out multi cpu using xv6

Maybe check for Haswell bits when the temps are created in translate.c and
use local_temp_new instead. Then add frees and news to the disas loop.
This will make things slower, but it will be correct, and it will fit
more readily into a generic memory instrumentation solution.
